# Core Python libraries (standard, but listed for clarity if packaging)
tkinter          # GUI framework (bundled with Python, but include for clarity)
logging          # Logging utilities
json             # JSON serialization/deserialization
os               # File and path utilities
re               # Regular expressions
dataclasses      # For structured data classes (Python 3.7+ has built-in)

# Third-party libraries (recommended for robustness)
regex            # Enhanced regex engine (optional, improves performance over re)
numpy            # Numerical operations (useful for scoring, future ML extensions)
pandas           # Data handling (summarization, exporting conversation logs)
scikit-learn     # For advanced intent/emotion classification if extended
nltk             # Natural Language Toolkit (lexicon, tokenization, sentiment)
spacy            # Industrial-strength NLP (optional, for richer intent/emotion parsing)

# GUI enhancements
ttkthemes        # Optional: themes for Tkinter
Pillow           # Image handling (if GUI needs icons or avatars)

# Persistence & storage
sqlalchemy       # Optional: if moving beyond JSON to database storage
tinydb           # Lightweight JSON-based database alternative
